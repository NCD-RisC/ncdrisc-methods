### 1. Conversion to consistent metric
#### Mean body-mass index (BMI)
[NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-mean-bmi](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/ncdrisc-methods/blob/main/NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-mean-bmi.pdf): This document describes methods for estimating mean BMI using BMI prevalence data where mean BMI was not available directly.

### 2. Data cleaning
[Data cleaning protocols](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/Data-cleaning-protocol): This repository describes the cleaning criteria for data in NCD-RisC database.

### 3. [development in process]
