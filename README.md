# NCD-RisC methods for analysing global NCD risk factor data
This repository hosts documents in relation to the methods used for the global pooling analyses by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration

## Data processing

### 1. Inclusion/exclusion 
[NCD-RisC inclusion/exclusion criteria](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/ncdrisc-methods/blob/main/Inclusion%20Exclusion%20criteria%20Protocol.pdf): This document describes the inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies to be included in the NCD-RisC database. 

### 2. Data cleaning
[Data cleaning protocols](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/Data-cleaning-protocol): This repository describes the cleaning criteria for data in NCD-RisC database.

### 3. Conversion to consistent metric
#### Mean body-mass index (BMI)
[NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-mean-bmi](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/ncdrisc-methods/blob/main/NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-mean-bmi.pdf): This document describes methods for estimating mean BMI using BMI prevalence data where mean BMI is not available directly.

#### Prevalence of BMI categories
[NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-prev-bmi](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/ncdrisc-methods/blob/main/NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-prev-bmi.pdf): This document describes methods for estimating the prevalence of BMI categories using data for mean BMI and/or for other BMI categories where data for the category of interest is not available directly.

#### Prevalence of BMI categories
[NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-diabetes-prevalence](https://github.com/NCD-RisC/ncdrisc-methods/blob/main/NCD-RisC-conversion-model-for-diabetes-prevalence.pdf): This document describes methods for estimating the prevalence of diabetes (defined as FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥6.5% or taking medication for diabetes) using data for mean FPG, mean HbA1c and/or for prevalence based other diabetes definitions where data for the primary outcome for diabetes prevalence is not available directly.

## Statistical modelling

### 1. Estimating trends in mean BMI and height for urban and rural children and adolescents
[R codes of statistical model](https://zenodo.org/record/7355602): This Zenodo repository provides the R codes for the statistical methods for estimating trends in mean BMI and height for children and adolescents in urban and rural areas. The results were published in [Nature 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05772-8).

### 2. Estimating trends in prevalence of underweight and obesity in children, adolescents and adults
[R codes of statistical model](https://zenodo.org/record/10534960): This Zenodo repository provides the R codes for the statistical methods for estimating trends in prevalence of underweight and obesity in children, adolescents and adults. The results were published in [Lancet 2024](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext).
